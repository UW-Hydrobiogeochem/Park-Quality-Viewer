# Here is where the code lives

# Motivation: 
# Green and blue spaces in urban areas provide refuge against hot temperatures
# Areas in King County impacted by air and water pollution
# Important to understand benefits and risks associated with existing and planned spaces for climate adaptation

# Import Data
# polygons representing parks + environmental layer (grid?)
# ideally, enviornmental data is at higher resolution than park data
# data will come in different projections --> will need to reconcile

# Clip data to area of interest --> both layers
# clip with a new polygon that is area of interest or bounding box of coordinates

# intersect data layers. polygon of parks with envrionmental data

# summarize environmental data by park

# visualize results -- not clear what exactly.
# map with park polygons color coded by environmental data measure?
